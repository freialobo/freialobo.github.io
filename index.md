### About Me

Iâ€™m originally from Mumbai in India, and now live in New York City. I'm currently on vacation and was most recently a Technology News Intern at Mashable. You can read all of my work [here](http://mashable.com/author/freia-lobo/). I recently graduated from NYU where I studied Economics and Computer Science. Last year I was named one of [NYU's Up and Comers](http://www.nyunews.com/2016/03/10/freia-lobo/). I help lead [Tech@NYU](http://techatnyu.org). In September, I'm joining [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freialobo) where I'll be an Associate Product Manger. I love [dosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa), coffee and cities. I read a lot of [books](http://freialobo.tumblr.com). You can email me at freialisa at gmail dot com.
